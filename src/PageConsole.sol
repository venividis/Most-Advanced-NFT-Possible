  THE CONSOLE — one route, one document, seven things you can do

  This replaces nineteen pages. Not by merging them: by asking a different
  question. The old site was organised the way the contracts are organised
  — a page per contract, named after the contract — and so a holder who
  wanted to let somebody borrow their token had to already know that the
  answer lived under a heading called "estate". Nineteen doors in a hallway
  is a sitemap. It is not an interface.

  The console is organised the way a person is: by what they came to do.
  Seven imperative sentences, in plain English, in the token's own colour.
  Everything else is the work.

  ── the margin, and why it is the point ──

  The owner found the fault that made this necessary, on a phone, before
  the design did. From an instrument he opened a flat page, from that page
  another token, from that token ITS instrument — a different NFT, running
  inside the first — and that one carried the same control, so it went
  round again. His words: "its cool but I dont know where they come from or
  why they are there."

  Both halves of that are requirements. It IS good that you can look into
  another token from inside your own; a console that forbade it would have
  answered the wrong complaint. What was wrong is that every level was
  byte-identical to the level above it, so there was no way to tell whose
  token you were reading, on which chain, or how far in you had walked.

  So the walk is drawn, and it is drawn as colour rather than as words:

      depth is the number of 1px rules in the left margin,
      each rule is the hue of the token at that level,
      and each rule is the way back out to it.

  Nothing says "you are two deep". You can see it. And what opens down
  there is the token's STILL — drawn on chain by Sigil — never its
  instrument, because two raymarchers on one thread is the other half of
  what the owner reported and no amount of legibility would fix it.

  ── what is server-rendered, and why it matters ──

  The crest, the still, the three identity sentences and all seven verb
  rows with their clocks are in the HTML that leaves this contract. They
  are not painted by script after a round of eth_calls. That is what makes
  the console's degradation honest: when nothing else works, what is left
  is a correct page about the right token, rather than a skeleton and a
  spinner over a number nobody read.
