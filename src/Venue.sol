  VENUE — the rest of the chain, held as seven addresses and read carefully

  This is the one contract in the collection that knows Uniswap exists. It
  holds the addresses, it does the reading, and it has no function that
  moves anything.

  ── two different jobs, and only one of them routes ──

  On a token's own market page this is a *comparison*. Every token in this
  collection is its own exchange: the holder is its only liquidity provider,
  the fee is theirs, and the price curve is set by how far the artwork has
  been turned through the fourth axis. Routing that page's trades to Uniswap
  would delete all of it — the token would earn nothing, the curve would
  price nothing, and the most original mechanism here would become decoration
  on what is really a Uniswap front end. So that page shows both prices side
  by side and says which is better, and the button still trades the token's
  own market.

  A market shown beside the deepest venue on chain, and still chosen, has
  been chosen for a reason. It also hands the holder the one signal they were
  missing — that their fee is too high, or their curve too tight — on the
  page they already use to manage it.

  Everything under `/swap`, `/pools`, `/explore`, `/earn` and `/vote` is the
  other job: ordinary assets, nothing to do with any token, routed to
  Uniswap because that is where the liquidity is. They are separate pages
  precisely so the two are never confused.

  ── this contract itself only reads ──

  `getPool`, `slot0`, `liquidity`, `token0`, `observe`: view calls, no
  approvals, no allowance, nothing to sign. It holds the router's and the
  position manager's addresses so a page can print them and a client can
  send to them, and it has no function that moves anything. Every
  transaction this site offers goes from the visitor's wallet straight to a
  Uniswap contract — nothing here stands in the middle of anybody's money,
  and there is no function here that could.

  ── the addresses are arguments, and every page prints them ──

  Nothing is hardcoded. All seven are constructor arguments, and every page
  that uses one also shows it, so a viewer can check it against Uniswap's
  own published deployments rather than against this contract's word. This
  matters more than it looks: the four v3 addresses are the same on Ethereum,
  Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon and are *different on Base*, so a contract
  that hardcoded mainnet's would be quietly wrong on exactly one chain.

  On a chain with no Uniswap deployment, pass zero: every read degrades to
  "no venue" and the pages say so instead of failing.

  ── the oracle, which is the part nobody uses ──

  `history` reads the pool's own ring buffer of observations. That is where
  a price chart comes from when there is no indexer and no subgraph: the
  pool has been recording a cumulative tick since it was created, and the
  difference between any two of those readings divided by the time between
  them is the time-weighted average price over that interval — computed by
  the pool, not by a server, and not falsifiable by whoever is serving the
  page.

  The catch is real and the page says it out loud: a pool is created with
  room for exactly one observation, so most pools can answer for the current
  block and nothing further back. Anyone may pay to lengthen that buffer,
  and the chart page offers the button, because "this pool has no memory"
  is a fixable condition rather than an excuse.
