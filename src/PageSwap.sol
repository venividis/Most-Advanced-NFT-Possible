  PageSwap — any pair, on the venue that has the liquidity

  Every token in this collection runs its own exchange, and its market page
  trades against that. This page is the other thing: two ordinary ERC-20s,
  nothing to do with any token, routed to Uniswap v3 because that is where
  the depth is.

  They are separate pages on purpose. A single card that sometimes traded
  the token's own market and sometimes routed elsewhere would be a card
  where the most important fact — who gets the fee, and whose curve set the
  price — is invisible.

  ── the dropdown, and the honest answer about it ──

  "Will it show every token Uniswap shows?" No, and nothing that runs
  without a server can. Uniswap's dropdown is a JSON file fetched from
  tokenlists.org at page load; the list decides what you can see and the
  list is not on chain.

  What this does instead is drop the middleman rather than reproduce it.
  The `<select>` is seeded from the chain — the wrapped native token, plus
  every asset a market in this collection actually trades — and beside it is
  a box for any address at all. Paste one and the page asks the token what
  it is, asks the factory whether a pool exists at each of the four fee
  tiers, and asks each of those pools how deep it is at the current tick.

  So: **anything Uniswap can trade, this page can trade**, because it checks
  the pool rather than checking a list. What it will not do is show you a
  name and let you assume the rest. A token list tells you a ticker. This
  tells you whether the trade fills.

  ── one thing this page does not do ──

  Single hop only. Uniswap's hosted router splits an order across pools and
  prices the gas of each route; a multi-hop path is a `bytes` argument and
  this client has no ABI coder, so it cannot build one. What it does do is
  quote all four fee tiers and take the best, which is stated on the card,
  because a page that quietly returned a worse price while implying it had
  searched would be worse than one that says where it looked.
