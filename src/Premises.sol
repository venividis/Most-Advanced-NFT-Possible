  THE FRONT DOOR

  Every token in this collection is already a website. `tokenURI` returns a
  complete WebGL2 application with a keccak, an ABI coder and a wallet
  client inside it, held in contract code and handed back as a `data:` URI.
  Nothing is fetched. That part was never the problem.

  What was missing is a place a stranger can stand. Not to look at the
  artwork — the artwork can be looked at without help — but to see that each
  of these objects runs an exchange, rents itself out, holds a vault nobody
  can empty, and draws any four-dimensional form it is handed, and then to
  actually use one of those without asking anybody's permission.

  ── the line this contract will not cross ──

  **Premises never serves the artwork through a page contract.** `/raw` and
  `/live` are handled here, in this file, from the hub and the renderer
  directly. Every other route delegates to a page contract, and every page
  contract is an immutable constructor argument.

  That split is the whole safety argument. The pages are the mutable-ish
  part of the system in the only sense that matters — replacing them means
  deploying a new Premises and pointing a name at it — and they are exactly
  the routes where being wrong is cosmetic. The two routes where being wrong
  would mean serving someone else's bytes as the artwork do not touch them.

  Even so, the honest claim is narrow: a compromised front door controls
  pages that link to and frame the artwork, and cannot alter one byte of the
  artwork itself, because it does not hold those bytes. If this contract is
  never deployed, every token renders. If it is abandoned, every token
  renders. If it is replaced, every token renders identically.

  ── ERC-5219: the contract is the origin ──

  `request(resource, params)` is an HTTP handler written in Solidity. An
  ERC-4804 / ERC-6860 client reaches it over `web3://` with no DNS:

      /                          the door: connect, and what you hold opens
      /terminal                  every function, one line at a time
      /swap                      any ERC-20 with a pool, against the chain's Uniswap v3
      /gallery  /gallery/<p>     the whole collection, wearing its stills
      /launch                    a v4 launchpad: token, hook, pool
      /hook/<address>            what a hook's address already says
      /lock                      the vault: tokens in, a date, no early exit
      /projector                 the 4-D renderer, free for anyone
      /seal                      the three seals: soulbind, account, kernel
      /keys                      session keys: scoped, expiring permissions
      /name                      an ENS name, bound to a token
      /chat                      the commons: one room, every token in it
      /rooms                     the groups this token has entered
      /room/<n>                  one group, numbered from 1
      /dm/<id>                   the room two tokens share
      /open  /open/<n>           every market that exists, from the pool's own list
      /services.json  /services.json/<n>    the same, for a program
      /token/<id>                one token's counter
      /token/<id>/live           the instrument, on a real origin
      /token/<id>/raw            that token's tokenURI, plain
      /token/<id>/face/<n>       one ERC-7160 face, plain
      /token/<id>/sigil.svg      the still, as an image
      /token/<id>/faces          what the three faces are
      /token/<id>/market         the swap card
      /token/<id>/pool           the holder's side: inventory, fee, bond, curve
      /token/<id>/rent           lease the instrument by the day
      /token/<id>/vault          the two hands, give, draw, verify
      /token/<id>/services.json  everything above, machine-readable

  A name resolves to this address through ERC-6821: the `contentcontract`
  TEXT record on the ENS resolver, holding either a plain `0x…` address or
  an ERC-3770 chain-scoped one like `eth:0x…`. If that record is unset the
  client falls back to the name's ordinary ERC-137 `addr()`. It is
  deliberately *not* `contenthash` — 6821 chose a human-readable text record
  over a codec nobody can read off a block explorer.

  An HTTP gateway is a convenience for everyone else,
  and a convenience is exactly what it should be: when the gateway is down
  the tokens are unaffected, which is the property a hostname compiled into
  bytecode can never have.
