  PageLaunch — a launchpad, and the one thing it can tell you that no
  hosted launchpad can

  A launch is four transactions: make a token, choose what may intercept its
  pool, create the pool, put liquidity in it. Everything a person would want
  to vary is a real parameter of one of those four, and this page exposes
  all of them rather than picking for you — supply and decimals, the split
  between pool and treasury, the starting price, the range, the fee tier or
  a dynamic fee, the tick spacing, and the hook.

  ── the hook, and why this page is worth having ──

  Uniswap v4 puts a hook's permissions in the low fourteen bits of its
  address. The PoolManager decides whether to call `beforeSwap` by testing
  one bit of the hook's own address — so the bits are not a description of
  the hook, they are the mechanism.

  Which means: **paste any hook address and this page tells you exactly what
  it will be allowed to do to you, with no call, no ABI, no source, and
  nothing its author can misstate.** A hook cannot claim not to intercept
  swaps while carrying the swap bit, because the bit is what causes the
  interception. That is a stronger guarantee than reading verified source,
  which tells you what the code says rather than what the pool will do.

  It cuts the other way too, and the page says so beside every hook it
  shows. A hook that can refuse withdrawals until Friday and a hook that can
  refuse them forever have **the same address shape**. The bits tell you the
  power exists. They cannot tell you it will be used kindly. Anyone who
  reads "liquidity locked" off an address and stops reading has learned the
  wrong half.

  ── what this page will not make ──

  Tokens with an owner. `Kiln.launch` produces a fixed supply with no mint,
  no pause, no blacklist and no upgrade path, and that is a deliberate limit
  rather than an omission: every one of those is a lever the deployer can
  pull against the people who bought. A launch that genuinely needs one
  needs a token this contract did not make — the pool step takes any address,
  so nothing here prevents it. It just will not carry this name.

  ── and what it cannot do ──

  Seed a v4 pool with liquidity. Creating one is reachable: `PoolKey` is five
  static fields, so `initialize` is six flat words. Adding liquidity goes
  through `modifyLiquidities(bytes,uint256)`, whose argument is a dynamic
  array of dynamic bytes with a decoder that rejects non-canonical encoding
  — and this client has no ABI coder. The page routes v4 liquidity nowhere
  rather than somewhere plausible, and says which step it stopped at.
