/*═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  CONSOLE READ — one call, and it cannot revert on you

  The console renders in a single response. That response reads the hub and
  then five satellites, and the satellites are the problem: this collection
  is deployed on five chains and no two of them carry the same set. A pool
  exists on Base and does not on Robinhood. A Nameplate answers on Ethereum
  and there is no ENS registry underneath it anywhere else.

  A page that reads them directly does not degrade on those chains. It
  REVERTS — one absent contract and the whole document is a 500, and the
  holder is told nothing at all about the token in front of them because a
  service they were not asking about is missing.

  So every satellite read is wrapped, and a wrapped read that fails is
  recorded as failed rather than as empty. That distinction is the entire
  reason this contract exists:

      a clear bit means NOBODY ANSWERED
      a set bit with a zero value means THE ANSWER WAS ZERO

  The console prints those differently — "not reported" against "none" —
  because they are different facts and a holder deciding whether to trust a
  number needs to know which one they are looking at. A viewer that renders
  a failed read as a zero is not degrading gracefully; it is lying quietly,
  which is worse than the revert it was trying to avoid.

  Only satellites this contract actually CALLS get a bit. There is no bit
  for a service that has not been wired yet, because a permanently clear
  bit would read as "asked and got nothing" when nobody ever asked.
