/*───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  PageMarket — the swap card, and the directory of everything open

  The version before this listed twelve facts and offered two text boxes: an
  integer amount in the token's smallest unit, and a floor the visitor was
  expected to work out by hand before they had seen the quote. It was
  accurate and nobody could have used it.

  This is the shape exchanges converged on, and it is worth being precise
  about why rather than treating it as decoration. Every element answers a
  question a person actually has, in the order they have it: what am I
  paying, what do I get, at what rate, what is the worst case, and is there
  one button or two. The approve-then-swap step is the one most often hidden
  and it is the one most worth showing, because it is two transactions and a
  person who does not know that will think the first one failed.

  What the page does NOT do is decide anything. The quote comes from
  `Pool.quote` at the block you are looking at, the floor is that quote less
  a slippage tolerance you set, the deadline is a number of minutes you set,
  and the calldata is assembled from selectors this contract computed. There
  is no router, no path-finding, no private mempool and no relayer. The
  transaction your wallet shows you is the transaction this page built, and
  you can read it in the page source.

    /*  The nearest honest thing to Uniswap's token dropdown.

        Uniswap's is a token *list* — a JSON file fetched from tokenlists.org
        over HTTP or IPFS — sitting in front of a router that finds a path
        across thousands of pools. Neither exists here and neither should:
        fetching a hosted list breaks the one property this whole collection
        is built on, and a dropdown offering ten thousand tokens of which
        four are tradeable is not a convenience, it is a lie told four
        thousand nine hundred and ninety-six times.

        What a market here has is one pair, fixed by its holder when they
        opened it. So the choice a person actually has is not "which token"
        but "which market", and that is a list the chain can answer
        completely: every id with an open market, enumerated by the pool
        itself. Everything offered here can be traded, because it was read
        from the thing that would execute the trade.                      */
