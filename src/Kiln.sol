  Kiln — where a launch is made

  A launchpad is four transactions with a lot of choices in front of them:
  make a token, choose what may intercept its pool, create the pool, put
  liquidity in it. This contract owns the first two. The other two go
  straight to Uniswap, from the visitor's wallet, like everything else here.

  ── the token has no owner, and that is the point ──

  `Coin` is a fixed-supply ERC-20 with no mint, no burn-from, no pause, no
  blacklist, no owner and no upgrade path. The entire supply exists at
  deployment and goes where the deployer said.

  That is a deliberate limit on what this launchpad will make, and it costs
  some flexibility. Every one of the omitted features is a lever the token's
  deployer can pull against everybody who bought it, and a launchpad that
  offers those levers is not a launchpad, it is a rug factory with a form.
  If a launch genuinely needs mintability, it needs a token this contract
  did not make — the pool step below takes any address, so nothing here
  stops that. It just will not be the thing with our name on it.

  Everything a person might actually want to vary — supply, decimals, the
  split between pool and treasury, the price, the range, the fee, the tick
  spacing, and what may intercept the pool — is varied at the launch, not
  smuggled into the token as a permission.

  ── mining a hook's address ──

  Uniswap v4 encodes a hook's permissions in the low fourteen bits of its
  address. So a hook that wants `beforeSwap` must *be deployed at* an
  address with that bit set, which means trying CREATE2 salts until one
  lands. Roughly 2^14 attempts for a full pattern.

  A browser cannot do that here: the client this collection ships has no
  keccak-256, on purpose. This contract does. `mine` is a `view` function
  that walks salts and returns the first that lands — run by the visitor's
  own node under `eth_call`, which executes and discards, so the search
  costs nobody anything and commits nothing. Sixty thousand candidates fit
  comfortably in one call; the page asks for a window at a time and says how
  many it has tried.

  That is the whole trick, and it is the reason a launchpad with hooks can
  exist on a page with no server: the expensive, keccak-shaped part of
  deploying a hook is a read, and reads are free.

  Gate — the one hook a launchpad actually needs

  Two promises every token launch makes and almost none of them can keep:

    "trading opens at <time>"   and   "liquidity is locked until <date>".

  Both are normally kept by a third-party locker holding the LP position, or
  by nothing at all. Under v4 they are kept by the pool: this hook holds
  `beforeSwap` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity`, and the PoolManager will not
  process either without asking it first.

  So the lock is not a promise about what somebody will do later. It is a
  pool that cannot pay the liquidity out, enforced by the same contract that
  would have paid it. And the two bits are readable off the hook's address
  before anyone buys, without trusting a word of this file.

  ── the half of that which is not reassuring ──

  **These are exactly the bits a trap has.** A hook that refuses withdrawals
  until Friday and a hook that refuses them forever have the same address
  shape, and no amount of reading the address distinguishes them. The page
  says so beside every hook it shows, this one included.

  What makes *this* hook safe is not the shape. It is that both timestamps
  are `immutable`, fixed at deployment, readable by anyone, and have no
  setter, no owner and no upgrade path — so the only thing that can open the
  gate is the clock, and the only thing that can keep it shut is the clock.
