  PageToken — the index, and each token's front counter

  The index is a directory of objects. The token page is a directory of what
  one object will do for you, which is a different thing and the reason this
  contract exists.

  Every token in this collection already had services. It has a market
  anyone may trade against, a vault anyone may pay into and nobody may empty,
  a projector anyone may call with any four-dimensional word, and a signature
  anyone may verify. What it did not have was a counter — somewhere a
  stranger could see that those exist, what they cost, and whether they are
  open right now. Four thousand businesses with no shopfronts.

  The board below is that, and it is built out of live reads rather than a
  list written at deploy time: a service is shown as open because the
  contract that provides it says so this block.
