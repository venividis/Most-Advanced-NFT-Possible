  IPSEITY ACCOUNT — the vault, with a promise it can keep

  ERC-6551 says the registry is canonical and the implementation is a
  parameter. Almost everyone passes the reference implementation and
  inherits its one structural gap: the holder can empty the account at any
  moment, including between agreeing a price for the token and settling it.
  A buyer paying for a token because of what its vault holds has no promise
  at all — the accounting is never violated, the assets are simply gone.

  So this is the implementation instead. Same registry, same CREATE2
  derivation, same interfaces. One addition: a seal.

  ── the seal ──

  SEALED UNTIL a timestamp. It ratchets — it can be pushed further out by
  the holder and lowered by nobody, including through a transfer — so a
  buyer reads one number and knows the floor under it cannot move before
  then. While it holds, nothing this account holds may leave it.

  ── how "nothing leaves" is enforced ──

  Not by listing the calls that move assets. That list cannot be completed:
  `transfer` and `transferFrom` are on it, but so is any protocol's
  `withdrawTo(address)`, `redeem`, `exit`, `sweep`, or a function nobody
  has written yet. A firewall that enumerates is a firewall with a hole in
  it shaped like whatever it has not heard of.

  So the account MEASURES. Before a sealed call it records its own ether
  balance and its balance of every asset on its manifest; after the call it
  checks that not one of them fell. What the call did is irrelevant — what
  matters is what is left. This is the Dave Held Chambers pattern, whose
  hardening pass reached the same conclusion the hard way.

  Measurement alone is still not enough, for one specific reason: an
  approval costs nothing at the moment it is granted. `approve(attacker,
  everything)` moves no balance, passes any measurement, and is drained in
  the next block. Measurement is blind to it precisely because nothing has
  happened yet.

  So the two defences are layered, each covering the other's blind spot:

    · MEASURED   nothing may be smaller after the call than before it,
                 whatever the call was
    · REFUSED    while sealed, no approval-family word executes at all, and
                 no ether leaves — because those are the moves whose damage
                 lands outside the window measurement can see

  ── what the seal does not do ──

  It does not stop the account acting. A sealed vault can still vote, claim,
  compound, sign, and call anything that leaves it no poorer. That is the
  whole reason for measuring rather than freezing: a vault that cannot act
  is not a vault, it is a safe.

  It also cannot promise about an asset nobody named. Only the manifest is
  measured. An asset that arrives after the seal, in a token contract that
  was never listed, can leave freely — so `manifest()` is public and a
  buyer should read it, not assume it.

            The account refuses any call that ends with a manifest asset
            unreadable, which is correct — going blind is a state change the
            seal cannot attest to. But that rule is a door a manifest asset
            can shut on the account at will: a token whose balanceOf reverts
            on a condition it controls makes EVERY sealed call revert, and a
            reverted call never persists, so the trap re-arms itself. An
            adversarial review shut an account for the full length of its
            seal with no way out — unguard refused, the ratchet refused,
            sessions dead on the same path.

            So an asset the account cannot currently read may be removed
            even while sealed. This gives nothing away: the seal was already
            unable to promise anything about an asset it cannot measure, and
            `unmeasurable()` has been saying so publicly the whole time. What
            it removes is a stranger's ability to freeze somebody else's
            account by breaking a token.

      A key the holder grants to something that is not them — a bot, a
      keeper, an agent, a model — so it can act on the Reach without
      holding the token.

      Every session is bounded four ways, and all four are checked on
      every call: an expiry it cannot extend, an allowlist of targets it
      cannot widen, an allowlist of selectors it cannot widen, and a
      cumulative spend cap it cannot raise. The holder revokes instantly
      and unilaterally.

      Three escalations are refused by shape rather than by budget:

        · a session cannot call this account. Otherwise its first act is
          grantSession on itself with no limits, and every bound above
          becomes decorative.
        · a session cannot grant an approval to a spender that is not
          itself on the target allowlist. `approve` is called *on* the
          token contract, so allowlisting the target says nothing about
          who is being trusted — the argument has to be checked, not the
          callee. (This is the one place a venue registry genuinely earns
          its keep, and where the Dave Held approve-gate is exactly right.)
        · a session cannot touch the Grip, because the Grip has no
          function that spends. Nothing enforces this; there is nothing
          to enforce.

      The seal composes on top: while the Reach is sealed, a session is
      subject to the same measurement and the same refusals as the holder.

        key had EVER held came back. Grant [poolA], revoke, re-grant [poolB],
        and it can still reach poolA. An adversarial review reproduced it.

      One approval and one action are one act, or neither happened. Without
      this a holder who wants to approve a venue and then use it has to send
      two transactions and live in the gap between them — and under a seal
      the gap is worse than untidy, because the first half can be front-run
      by anything that watches the mempool.

      The measurement wraps the WHOLE batch rather than each call, and that
      is deliberate. Per-call measurement would refuse the ordinary shape of
      real work — withdraw from one venue, deposit into another — because the
      account is genuinely poorer between the two. The seal's promise has
      always been about the state a transaction leaves behind, not about every
      instant inside it. Nothing can observe the middle of a batch except code
      the batch itself called, and that code cannot re-enter (see
      `nonReentrant`) or move an asset the ends do not account for.

      Approvals are still refused call by call, because an approval's damage
      lands in a later block where no end-of-batch measurement can reach it. */

    /*═══ what a sealed account may say to an asset it has promised ═══

      This used to be a list of six approval selectors, refused by name. The
      file's own comment three screens up says an enumeration cannot be
      completed — that is the entire argument for measuring balances instead
      of listing transfer words — and then the approval defence was an
      enumeration anyway, because measurement is structurally blind to an
      authority that moves nothing yet.

      An adversarial review walked straight through it with Permit2's
      `approve(address,address,uint160,uint48)`. Same standing custody,
      different word, not on the list. It never would be: the list can only
      contain approval shapes somebody had already thought of.

      So the polarity is inverted, at the one boundary where it can be.
      While sealed, a call to an asset ON THE MANIFEST must carry a selector
      from a short allowlist. Everything else is refused — approvals in every
      shape, permits in every shape, delegations, and words nobody has
      invented yet, all by the same rule and without naming any of them.

      The allowlist is exactly the two words whose damage measurement can
      see, because those are the only ones that need to be allowed:

          transfer(address,uint256)                 0xa9059cbb
          transferFrom(address,address,uint256)     0x23b872dd

      A call to anything NOT on the manifest is unrestricted. An approval on
      an asset the seal never promised is an approval over something nobody
      was promised, and refusing it would be theatre.

      The cost is real and worth stating: a holder who wants to `claim()` on
      a manifest asset while sealed cannot. They can unguard it before
      sealing, or not guard it. Deny-by-default means some legitimate things
      are denied; that is what the word default is doing.                  */

    /*═══════════════════ ERC-1271 — the voice, and its wall ═══════════════

      A sealed account used to return zero to every signature, which is the
      safe answer and the wrong one. A signature is how an account says
      something, and an account that cannot say anything for a year is not
      sealed, it is gagged. It cannot prove to a counterparty that it is the
      thing holding what it holds. For a token whose whole argument is that
      it acts, that is half the argument missing.

      But the reason for the gag was real: an unrestricted `isValidSignature`
      on a sealed account is a hole straight through the seal. Sign a market
      order, hand the assets over, and no measurement ever runs — because no
      call was ever made to this contract to measure around. Refusing every
      signature closed that hole by removing the capability, at the cost of
      the capability.

      The resolution is domain separation, and it is arithmetic rather than a
      list. (Taken from the DAVE V2 design note, which is right about this.)

        UNSEALED   any digest. The account is not promising anything, so its
                   signature is worth exactly what its holder's is.

        SEALED     only digests this account can rebuild under ITS OWN
                   EIP-712 domain. The caller hands over the preimage; the
                   account recomputes the digest from `IPSEITY_ATTESTATION`
                   with `verifyingContract = address(this)` and checks it
                   equals the hash it was asked about, before it verifies a
                   single byte of signature.

      Every venue hashes its orders under its own domain separator — its own
      name, its own version, its own verifyingContract. So an order hash can
      never be the output of this account's `_attestationDigest`, and a sealed
      account is structurally incapable of signing one. Not disallowed:
      incapable. There is no venue to add to an allowlist and no allowlist to
      get wrong.

      What a sealed account CAN still do is say what it is — attest to a
      statement, prove its conviction to a counterparty, sign into something
      that speaks its language. It says who it is and cannot promise what it
      holds, which is exactly the shape of a seal.                          */
