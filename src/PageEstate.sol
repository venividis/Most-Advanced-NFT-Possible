  PageEstate — the will, and the window

  Two arrangements about a token you are not standing next to, on one page
  because they answer the same question from opposite ends. Succession is
  what happens if you never come back. Consignment is what happens while
  you are away on purpose.

  Both move a token without you present, so both are written here with
  their costs in the open rather than behind a star. A page that has to
  bury what a control gives away is a page describing a control that
  should not exist.
