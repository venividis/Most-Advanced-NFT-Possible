/*───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Nameplate — an ENS resolver that answers for the collection

  "What would the web3 address be?" gets its final answer here. Point a
  name you own at this resolver and bind it to a token, and the name means
  the token everywhere ENS is read:

    addr(node)                    → the token's own 6551 account, so
                                    sending ETH to the name funds the token
    text(node,"contentcontract")  → the Premises, per ERC-6821 — a web3://
                                    browser resolves the name straight into
                                    this site with no IPFS and no gateway
    text(node,"avatar")           → the token's sigil, as an eip155 NFT
                                    reference every ENS app knows how to draw
    text(node,"url")              → an https gateway link, for browsers that
                                    speak nothing else

  And once a parent name is claimed, every token is addressable with no
  registration at all: `7.yourname.eth` resolves to token 7, by ENSIP-10
  wildcard — the name exists the moment the token does.

  ── holding the name IS the binding ──

  A name does not have to be bound at all. Put the ENS name's own NFT into
  a token's account and the name means that token, with no transaction on
  this contract and nothing to remember: custody is the claim.

  That is the stronger claim, so it wins over `bind`. A recorded intention
  can go stale — bind a name to token 3, move the name into token 7's
  account, and only one of those two is still true. Custody is the one
  that is true now.

  It also makes a name behave like everything else this collection holds:
  sell the token and the name goes with it, because the name was never
  yours separately from the token.

  The ordinary place for it is the REACH, which can send it back out again
  whenever you like. Nothing here requires more ceremony than moving the
  name. The GRIP is available and is not the default: it receives and
  cannot send, so a name put there is the token's permanently, which is a
  promise worth making deliberately and never by accident.

  An account's own word is not enough. Any contract can implement
  `token()` and claim to be token 7's; the registry's answer for that id
  must come back as the very address holding the name, or the claim is
  discarded.

  ── who may do what, and the absence of an admin ──

  Binding a name requires owning it in the ENS registry (wrapped names
  included) — this contract re-checks the registry on every bind rather
  than trusting a caller's word. The parent slot for wildcards is claimed
  once, by whoever owns that parent name at the moment of claiming, and
  never moves again: a write-once slot whose authorization is the ENS
  registry itself is not an admin, it is a mailbox with a name on it.
  Nothing else here can be set by anyone.

  On a chain with no ENS registry the constructor takes zero and every
  bind refuses honestly; the resolver still deploys so the address stays
  the same on every chain, which is this collection's habit.

      A resolver runs where its name lives, and .eth names live on
      Ethereum. Reading `block.chainid` there answers `1` for every query,
      so a single name could only ever point at the Ethereum deployment —
      which is the wrong answer for four fifths of an edition that was
      deliberately partitioned.

      The partition is also the fix. Every id belongs to exactly one chain
      by arithmetic, so the name needs no chain syntax at all: `1500.<name>`
      is a Base token because 1500 is in Base's band, and a reader types
      nothing they would have to be told. What the resolver cannot derive is
      where the other four deployments sit, because those addresses did not
      exist when it was constructed. That is the only thing a station holds.

      The local chain needs no station: PREMISES and HUB are immutables, so
      the deployment the resolver sits in always answers. Stations are for
      the other four, they are write-once, and the authorisation is the ENS
      registry's opinion of who owns the parent — the same mailbox rule the
      parent slot already uses, not an admin.                            */
