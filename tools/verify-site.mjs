  IPSEITY · each token's shopfront, and the rent it collects

  The front door was already verified by `verify-premises.mjs`, against the
  one claim that makes an index safe to have: it never serves the artwork.
  This is the other half — the part where a stranger can actually *use* a
  token, and where the token gets paid.

  Three things are under test, in order of how badly each would fail.

  ── 1. an injected script would be same-origin with a wallet ──

  A market's pair is two ERC-20 addresses the token holder chose, and
  `symbol()` on them returns a string that holder wrote. Those strings go on
  a page. That page is served by the same contract, on the same origin, as
  `/token/<id>/live` — which exists precisely so wallet extensions *will*
  inject into it.

  So a `<script>` surviving into a market page is not a cosmetic bug. It is
  script execution next to a connected wallet. The suite deploys a token
  whose symbol is a script tag and asserts it comes out inert.

  ── 2. a page that reverts is a shop with the shutters down ──

  Five more hostile tokens: one that refuses to answer, one that answers in
  `bytes32` like MKR, one that answers with eight kilobytes, one that
  declares a length longer than the payload it sent, and one that claims 200
  decimals so `10 ** decimals` overflows. Each is put into a real market and
  every route is fetched. A page that dies on one row is a directory nobody
  can read.

  ── 3. the rent has to add up ──

  `Lease` holds ether belonging to two different parties at once, and the
  interesting case is the lease cut short: the token is sold mid-term, the
  ERC-4907 user is cleared, and what was paid has to split by elapsed time
  without either side being able to take the other's part. The invariant
  checked after every operation is that the contract's balance covers
  everything it owes.

/*════════════ the Uniswap card, actually driven ════════════

  This is the section that would catch the one mistake on this whole site
  that costs somebody money.

  Two Uniswap routers have an `exactInputSingle`. Their params structs
  differ by exactly one field — the older one carries a `deadline` at index
  4 and SwapRouter02 does not — and sending one shape to the other router
  does not revert. It shifts `recipient` and every amount by one word and
  executes something nobody asked for.

  So the mocks do not merely perform the trade. They decode the struct and
  record every field, and the assertions below check field by field that the
  word the client wrote into `amountIn` arrived as `amountIn`. Then the
  whole thing is done again against a second deployment wired to the other
  router with the other kind, because a page that is right about one shape
  and silent about the other is a page that is right by accident.
