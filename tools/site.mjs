/*  `read` is a SEPARATE capability from messaging and the difference is

    pull, where the answer lands on the chain that asked instead of a
    push that lands on the chain being told. Measured from Unichain,
    reading Ethereum costs 1.957e-5 ETH against 3.404e-4 to message it —
    seventeen times cheaper, because the answer arrives at 0.0005 gwei.

    Robinhood mainnet carries SendUln302 and ReceiveUln302 at v3.0.2 and
    a 623-byte BlockedMessageLib, and no read library; its read channels
    resolve to nothing. So it can speak and be spoken to, and it cannot
    take part in a read in either direction — it can neither ask nor be
    asked. That is the whole of the limitation, and the first two ways I
    wrote it down were both wrong: "can never be heard" is false, it
    receives perfectly.

    Robinhood's TESTNET (46630) has no endpoint at any of the three
    canonical addresses — mainnet-early, mainnet-late, or the testnet
    address 0x6EDCE654…f10f. The chain answers; LayerZero is simply not
    deployed on it. An earlier probe of mine checked the testnet with
    mainnet addresses and concluded the same thing for the wrong reason,
    which is how a right answer can still be a bad measurement. Base
    Sepolia was used as the control: the same probe finds its endpoint at
    the testnet address, eid 40245, with three read libraries.          */

  THE PARTITION — one edition of 4096, cut into five bands

  A token's number is its name. Two tokens numbered #7 would not be two
  tokens with the same name, they would be a broken promise about how many
  there are — and no bridge, quorum or oracle is needed to keep that
  promise if the numbers simply cannot collide. Each chain is handed a
  contiguous band in its constructor, and `mint` issues `FIRST_ID +
  totalSupply` and refuses past `LAST_ID`. The partition is enforced by
  arithmetic on each chain independently, with nothing to trust and no
  message to miss.

  This is the reason the collection can be multi-chain at all without
  becoming a bridge. Nothing crosses. There is one edition and five places
  it is issued from, the way one print run can be signed in five cities.

  WHY THESE SIZES. The edition is 4096 = 2^12, so every band is a power of
  two on a power-of-two boundary — a split you can check in your head and
  a reader can verify without arithmetic. Ethereum, Base and Unichain take
  a full quarter each; BNB and Robinhood split the last quarter.

  Ethereum holds the first band because #1 should exist where the edition
  is canonical, and because Ethereum is the one chain whose continued
  existence needs no argument. Unichain gets a full quarter despite being
  the newest, because it is the cheapest place to turn a solid — the
  gesture the whole collection is built on — and it carries the v4 stack
  natively. Robinhood's band is the smallest not as a judgement of the
  chain but because it is the only one of the five that cannot be read
  from: it carries a LayerZero endpoint but no read library, so a token
  minted there can speak and can never be heard by the others. A smaller
  band is the honest size for the place with the least connectivity.

  These bounds go into an `immutable` at construction. They cannot be
  changed afterwards, on purpose: a band that could move is a band that
  could be made to overlap, and the whole guarantee is that it cannot.

  What LayerZero actually costs here, quoted live against the real
  endpoints rather than read off a docs page. Kept because these numbers
  decide the architecture, and the scripts that produced them were
  throwaway.

  THE ONE THAT MATTERS: from Unichain, READING Ethereum costs 1.957e-5 ETH
  and MESSAGING Ethereum costs 3.404e-4 — seventeen times more. The read's
  answer lands on Unichain at 0.0005 gwei; the message lands on L1. Pulling
  state is radically cheaper than pushing it, and it is the reason the
  design here reads rather than sends.

  READ, quoted from Unichain (eid 30320), which carries the read library —
  only 30 of 183 LayerZero mainnet deployments do:
    one read                       1.957e-5 ETH
    each extra target, same command 1.021e-5
    eight targets in one command    9.102e-5
    lzReduce (fold on arrival)     +1.021e-5
    lzMap                          +3.06e-5
  Unichain can read Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB, Polygon and
  itself. It CANNOT read Robinhood (30416) — that endpoint has no read
  library on mainnet or testnet, so Robinhood can speak and never be heard.

  SEND, measured from production OApps on the same lanes:
    Unichain -> Base        2.552e-5      Unichain -> Optimism  2.170e-5
    Unichain -> BNB         3.132e-5      Unichain -> Arbitrum  4.379e-5
    Unichain -> Ethereum    3.404e-4      Robinhood -> Ethereum 3.709e-4

  PAYLOAD IS ALMOST FREE, so size is never the constraint the fixed fee is:
    64 bytes 2.691e-5 · 10,000 bytes 2.789e-5  (~1e-10 ETH per byte)
    maxMessageSize is exactly 10,000 — 10,001 reverts InvalidMessageSize.
    The section word is 32 bytes. It fits three hundred times over.
    Ordered execution costs +3.51e-8. Effectively free.

  TWO PROTOCOL FACTS THAT DECIDE ADMISSIBILITY UNDER THE HOUSE RULES:
    · An unwired lane fails at QUOTE time. The default verifier is a
      934-byte contract whose whole behaviour is to revert with "Please set
      your OApp's DVNs and/or Executor". A lane that is not configured says
      so instead of accepting a message that would never arrive.
    · Delivery is permissionless — `lzReceive` has no access control, so
      once the DVNs verify, anyone may deliver. The paid executor is a
      convenience and never a dependency. No server is required.
    · `setConfig` + `setDelegate(address(0))` in a constructor freezes the
      DVN set as hard as the bytecode: no admin key, no upgrade path.
