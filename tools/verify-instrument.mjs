  IPSEITY · the instrument is not a browser

  A deck used to live in this document: up to four contract-rendered pages,
  live, inside the instrument. It worked. It was the wrong idea, and the
  property worth testing now is its absence.

  Opening a surface left two documents running, each with its own loop, one
  of them showing a DIFFERENT token from the one you were inside. That is
  not a performance bug with a throttle for an answer — it is a design
  where the place you were going had to fit inside the thing you were
  leaving.

  So: no iframe is ever created, whatever you click. A node opens its own
  control or the plate, both drawn here. And the one way out is `/connect`,
  which binds a wallet and then LEAVES, so the loop ends with the document
  rather than being paced down behind another one.

  Absence is the hardest thing to test, because a suite that checks a
  feature is gone passes just as well when the whole page is broken. So
  this drives the instrument first — nodes, palette, keys — and only then
  asserts what did not happen.
