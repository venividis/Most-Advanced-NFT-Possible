  IPSEITY · the portal

  The claim under test: this door holds no content, opens onto any chain it
  knows, and never says the wrong thing about why it could not open.

  It runs against a LOCAL chain — a Premises deployed here in-process — so
  the suite does not depend on a public RPC being up, and so a failure
  means the gateway is wrong rather than that Base Sepolia was busy. The
  routing table and the refusals are exercised without a network at all.
