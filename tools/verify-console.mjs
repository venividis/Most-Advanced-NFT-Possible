  IPSEITY · the console, held to what it claims

  The console replaced nineteen pages with one route. That is a bigger
  change than it sounds, because nineteen pages failed loudly — a broken
  one 404'd — and one page fails quietly: it renders, it looks right, and
  a number in it is wrong.

  Four properties are under test, in the order of how badly each fails.

  ── 1. two copies of one naming table ──

  The seven verbs are spelled in `PageConsole.sol` (which renders the rows and
  resolves `/c/<id>/<verb>`) and again in `engine/console.js` (which takes
  the typed word). Two copies of a naming table is the exact failure this
  whole redesign was a response to, and it fails in the worst possible way:
  the console shows a holder a verb, the holder types it, and nothing
  opens — or worse, the wrong lane does. So the two tables are read out of
  the two files and compared, string for string, in order.

  ── 2. a failed read must not render as a zero ──

  `ConsoleRead` wraps every satellite call. The whole point of the wrapping
  is that a read which REVERTED is recorded differently from a read that
  returned zero — a clear bit against a set bit with a zero in it. A viewer
  that renders those the same is not degrading gracefully, it is lying
  quietly, which is worse than the revert it was avoiding. The suite points
  the reader at a chain with no pool and no lease and asserts the bits.

  ── 3. the walk must never reach the contract ──

  The walk rides in the URL fragment, and the claim made in the client's
  own header is that ERC-5219 hands `Premises.request` the path and the
  query and never the hash. If that were wrong the walk would be in every
  gateway's cache key and every token's console would be cached per-walk.
  A claim in a comment is not a test, so the fragment is put through a real
  request and the response is compared byte for byte with the one that had
  no fragment.

  ── 4. the still is a reference, not a raymarcher ──

  The heat the owner reported came from two 4-D fields on one thread. The
  console's rule is that exactly one control in the whole document produces
  a raymarcher and it navigates. So: the console must reference the sigil
  route, must not inline a base64 blob, and must not carry an iframe.
