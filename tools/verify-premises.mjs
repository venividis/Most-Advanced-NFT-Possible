  IPSEITY · the front door

  Every token is already a website. This is the thing that was missing:
  somewhere to send a person who does not own one yet.

  The claim under test is not "the index works". It is the constraint that
  makes an index safe to have at all:

      PREMISES NEVER SERVES THE ARTWORK.

  It serves a document that names the artwork, by emitting the token's own
  data: URI read from the hub at request time, and it stores none of it.

  Be exact about what that buys. Premises composes the whole page, so a
  compromised Premises could put anything in that frame — no assertion here
  can prevent that, and claiming otherwise would be the kind of guarantee
  this project exists not to make. What it buys is that the ARTWORK is
  untouched: the bytes live in the collection, anyone can call tokenURI
  directly, /raw hands back the URI to check against, and every token
  renders identically whether this contract exists, is abandoned, or is
  replaced by something else entirely. The index is convenience. Nothing
  depends on it, which is the only reason it is safe to have one.

  So the assertions are: the honest deployment emits exactly tokenURI(id),
  and the deployed code contains none of the document — a reader can verify
  both against the source.

  Also under test: a request for nonsense is a 404, not a revert. A client
  asking for a path that does not exist deserves an answer.
