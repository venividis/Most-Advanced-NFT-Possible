/*───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  A Uniswap v3 deployment, only as far as this collection reads and writes it.

  Faithful in the ways that decide whether the real thing would work:

    · every function signature and return shape is the one the real contract
      has, including the seven values of `slot0` and the two arrays of
      `observe`;
    · `getPool` is symmetric in its first two arguments, the way the real
      factory's mapping is, and returns zero for a pair with no pool;
    · a pool names its own factory, so the reader's self-check has something
      to check;
    · **the routers decode their params struct and record every field**,
      which is the whole point of them being here. Two Uniswap routers have
      an `exactInputSingle` and their structs differ by one field. The wrong
      shape does not revert — it shifts `recipient` and every amount by a
      word. A mock that simply performed the trade would pass either way.
      These record what they decoded, so the test can assert that the word
      the client put in `amountIn` arrived as `amountIn`.

  Everything else — ticks, positions, the real curve — is absent, because
  nothing here computes against it.

  Plus the misbehaving ones. The factory address is chosen by whoever
  deploys Venue and a pool address comes back from that factory, so on a
  wrong or hostile configuration these are calls into whatever happens to be
  there. A page a bad address can switch off is a page a bad address
  controls.
